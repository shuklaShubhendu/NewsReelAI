# News Reel AI

**Generate engaging news videos automatically using AI-powered tools.**

News Reel AI is a Python-based pipeline that automates the creation of news videos by fetching trending news articles, generating scripts with AI, and producing videos using Stable Diffusion and other multimedia tools. This project streamlines the process of transforming raw news data into visually appealing video content, perfect for content creators, journalists, or media enthusiasts.

## Features

- **News Fetching**: Retrieves trending news articles from RSS feeds, with fallback to full article scraping when needed.
- **AI Script Generation**: Creates structured video scripts based on article content using advanced AI models.
- **Video Creation**: Generates videos with visuals powered by Stable Diffusion, combining narration and dynamic visuals.
- **Customizable Output**: Saves videos with sanitized, unique filenames based on article titles and timestamps.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management ensures smooth pipeline execution with meaningful feedback.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable with separate modules for news fetching, script generation, and video creation.

## How It Works

1. **Fetch Trending News**: The pipeline pulls the latest trending articles from RSS feeds (top 5 by default) and selects one for processing. It prioritizes RSS summaries but can scrape full articles if summaries are too short.
2. **Generate Script**: An AI model processes the selected articleâ€™s title and content to create a structured script with scenes tailored for video production.
3. **Create Video**: The script is transformed into a video using Stable Diffusion for visuals, with the output saved to a designated folder with a clean, timestamped filename.
4. **Output**: The final video is saved in the `output/` directory, and the pipeline reports execution time and success status.

## Sample Video

Check out a sample video generated by News Reel AI:

**Title**: SC Rejects Staying Waqf Law, Seeks Centre's Reply  
**File**: [SC_rejects_staying_Waqf_law_seeks_Centre_s_reply_o_20250416_174217.mp4](output/SC_rejects_staying_Waqf_law_seeks_Centre_s_reply_o_20250416_174217.mp4)

### How to Play the Video

- **Locally**: Navigate to the `output/` folder in your project directory and open the video file (`SC_rejects_staying_Waqf_law_seeks_Centre_s_reply_o_20250416_174217.mp4`) using a media player like VLC, Windows Media Player, or QuickTime.
  ```bash
  # Example command to open with VLC (if installed)
  vlc output/SC_rejects_staying_Waqf_law_seeks_Centre_s_reply_o_20250416_174217.mp4
  ```
- **On GitHub**: If the repository is hosted on GitHub, you can download the video from the `output/` folder or view it directly in supported browsers by clicking the link above (ensure the video is uploaded to the repository).
- **Note**: Ensure you have a compatible media player installed. For best results, use a player that supports MP4 formats, such as VLC or MPC-HC.

## Prerequisites

To run News Reel AI, ensure you have the following:

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies**: See the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section below
- **API Keys** (if applicable): Some AI models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) may require API keys or access to specific services
- **Stable Diffusion Setup**: Ensure Stable Diffusion is configured locally or via a cloud service
- **FFmpeg**: Required for video processing (install separately)
- **Media Player**: To play generated videos (e.g., VLC, Windows Media Player)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-reel-ai.git
   cd news-reel-ai
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Settings**:
   - Edit `config.py` to set your output folder (`OUTPUT_FOLDER`) and any API keys or model-specific settings.
   - Example:
     ```python
     OUTPUT_FOLDER = "output/"
     # Add API keys or model configurations here
     ```

5. **Install FFmpeg**:
   - Download and install FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or via a package manager:
     ```bash
     # On Ubuntu
     sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
     # On macOS
     brew install ffmpeg
     ```

---

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`):

- `news_fetcher`: Custom module to fetch news articles via RSS feeds and web scraping
- `script_generator`: Custom module for AI-powered script generation
- `video_creator`: Custom module for video creation with Stable Diffusion
- `re`: For filename sanitization
- Other dependencies (add to `requirements.txt` as needed):
  ```plaintext
  requests
  feedparser
  # Add Stable Diffusion or AI model dependencies here
  ```

To generate a `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Pipeline**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **What Happens**:
   - The script fetches trending news articles.
   - It generates a script based on the selected article.
   - A video is created and saved to the `output/` folder with a sanitized filename (e.g., `Article_Title_20250531_011623.mp4`).
   - Execution time and status are printed to the console.

3. **Example Output**:
   ```
